## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jasonmhead/thought_kernel
cd thought_kernel

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Define Your System**:
   - Describe your system (S)
   - Specify performance metric (P) to optimize
   - List any constraints (C)

2. **Run the Optimizer**:
   ```bash
   python thought_kernel.py --system "Your system description" --metric "Performance metric" --constraints "Your constraints"
   ```

3. **Review Results**:
   - The system will output optimized solutions
   - Performance metrics for each solution variant
   - Suggested system design improvements

## üîç How It Works

Thought Kernel follows a six-step optimization process:

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Breaks down the system into core tasks
2. **Scenario Generation** - Creates representative test cases
3. **Strategy Formulation** - Proposes diverse optimization approaches
4. **Parallel Exploration** - Tests multiple solution variants
5. **Performance Evaluation** - Ranks solutions by effectiveness
6. **Iterative Refinement** - Improves solutions through multiple cycles

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in your project root with the following structure:

```yaml
# AI Model Configuration
openai:
  api_key: your_openai_key
  model: gpt-4-turbo
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 4096

# OpenRouter Configuration
openrouter:
  api_key: your_openrouter_key
  model: anthropic/claude-3-opus  # or any OpenRouter model
  temperature: 0.7

# Default provider (openai, ollama, or openrouter)
provider: openai

# Logging
logging:
  level: INFO
  file: thought_kernel.log

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your API keys and preferences
   ```

3. **Run the optimizer**:
   ```bash
   # Basic usage
   python -m thought_kernel optimize --system "Your system description" \
     --metric "Performance metric" \
     --constraints "Your constraints"
