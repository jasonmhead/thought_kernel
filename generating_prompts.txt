How could I use this technique to create an optimize a robot arm control system?https://crfm.stanford.edu/2025/05/28/fast-kernels.html

---------------
Devise a general strategy that could be applied to any number of problems using the concepts in the paper - generalize to outsider of creating kernels and the specifics of the paper - think broadly - use logic symbols to define the method then generalize back to t

---------------
Now generate an llm prompt to implement this instructing the model what to do at each step depending on what step it is at - design a system for the llm to follow

---------------
Optimize this for branching parallel exploration, bringing together best results at each iteration for a suggested system design for evaluation, and use llm vs human feedback for error resolution.
Where sub system components are re-intragrated at each iteration etc.

---------------
Write a python script implementing this logic using: mysqlite, and ollama or open router to define models. Look at original paper for hints as to how multiple models could be useful: https://crfm.stanford.edu/2025/05/28/fast-kernels.html

---------------
Optimize to use parallel threading where possible to avoid non-depedant step bottlenecks - switch to Postgres if needed

---------------
Does the script conform to current best practices of llm tool use where an llm can decide the best tools to use - iterate through tools is not a good solution for example

---------------
Implement in a full script

---------------
Is this implemented in current script- be brief for this answer:
Threading: Optimized for I/O-bound tasks (LLM calls, DB writes). For CPU-bound tools, consider ProcessPoolExecutor

---------------
Optimize for cpu bound processes then in all cases where it makes sense

---------------
Be brief for this answer: does this script support using the "llm as a judge" technique where one of the evaluation tools is a llm judge that returns some evaluation output.
So that it can be used for objective code based and also more subjective evaluations and system development who's output may mot be code?
It it generalized to support both?

>> "Yes, the script supports the "LLM as a judge" technique. Tools in config.json can include an LLM-based evaluator (e.g., a python_function calling an LLM to judge output quality), returning evaluation metrics for both objective (e.g., code performance) and subjective (e.g., system design quality) cases. The generalized tool framework (execute_tool) and schema validation support diverse outputs, enabling both code-based and non-code evaluations."
